Static pricing models
--------
list price (price/unit)
product feature/customer segment - dependent (feature A enabled?)
volume dependent (list price, but tiered)

Dynamic pricing
------
negotiated
yield management (depends on inventory and/or time of purchase)
real-time (based on supply and demand)
auction (competitive bidding)

-----
billing plan
	keep billing separate (i.e., presentation)
	more declarative syntax for billing plan
	subcategorize according to pricing model/input?
	
pricing models are calculating totals
	need to be sending back data
	calculations are secondary
	send back more data from pricing models
	billing needs to be able to marry these up
